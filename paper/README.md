# Scripts for reproducing our paper's results

Scripts are all saved in Jupyter notebooks (which should be viewable directly on GitHub), or in files such as `README` or `script`. To reproduce results in section 4.3 (ultra-compress data), the same scripts in 4.1 can be used. Simply change all `outfile` names from ending in `.vcf.gz` to `.jlso`. This is described [here](https://openmendel.github.io/MendelImpute.jl/dev/man/ultra+compress/) in our documentation.

If anything is unclear, not present, or you cannot reproduce our results, please [file an issue](https://github.com/OpenMendel/MendelImpute.jl/issues).
